when '_' is not included in 'cpo' options, make the w motion during a change operation
behave as expected.

This has been requested several times:

https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/4390

Also make dw work as expected

So in summary, if you want to have the w motion work more consistent,
remove the 'z' from the cpo settings.
