> My private MQ Patches series for Vim

This is my private mq patch collection. Most of them have probably already been posted on the [vim-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev) mailing list. If not, then that patch is probably experimental.

Among those patches, there is ~~the famous [breakindent patch](https://github.com/chrisbra/vim-mq-patches/blob/master/breakindent_patch) and~~ (now included upstream with [patch 7.4.338](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/qrhUA-dt7SY/9TtlIVu9r2oJ)) the [variable tabstops](https://github.com/chrisbra/vim-mq-patches/blob/master/var_tabstops) patch (both should apply cleanly to current Vim source, if you apply both, you'll probably get some offset warnings).

###Note:

Not all patches will apply to upstream vim source (or even make sense nowadays).
