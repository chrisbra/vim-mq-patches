> My private MQ Patches series for Vim

This is my private mq patch collection. Most of them have probably already been posted on the [vim-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev) mailing list. If not, then that patch is probably experimental.

###Note:

Not all patches will apply to upstream vim source.
