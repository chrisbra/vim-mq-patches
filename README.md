> My private MQ Patches series for Vim

This is my private mq patch collection. Most of them have probably already been posted on the [vim-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev) mailing list. If not, then that patch is probably experimental.

Among those patches, there is the famous [breakindent patch](https://github.com/chrisbra/vim-mq-patches/blob/master/breakindent_patch) and the [variable tabstops](https://github.com/chrisbra/vim-mq-patches/blob/master/var_tabstops_orig) patch (both should apply cleanly to current Vim source, if you apply both, you'll probably get some offset warnings).

###Note:

Not all patches will apply to upstream vim source.
